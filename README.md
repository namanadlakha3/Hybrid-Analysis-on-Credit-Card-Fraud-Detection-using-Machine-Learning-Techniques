Hybrid Analysis on Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques  
In this paper we would be implementing novel Ensemble machine learning technique which combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model. In the pre-processing phase, feature extraction and selection were performed on the original dataset. We analyzed different machine learning models of Supervised, Unsupervised and Deep learning on our sampled dataset.
Getting Started
Prerequisites: Anaconda navigator, sklearn, imblearn, keras, Tensor Flow. 
Installing Anaconda Steps:
•	visit Anaconda.com/downloads
•	Select Windows
•	Download the .exe installer
•	Open and run the .exe installer
•	Open the Anaconda navigator
•	Run Jupyter Notebook
Installing sklearn, imblearn, keras, tensor flow Steps:
•	Open Anaconda Prompt
•	Type: pip install sklearn and press enter
•	Type: pip install imblearn and press enter
•	Type: pip install keras and press enter
•	Type: pip install tensor flow and press enter

With the help of sklearn these are some of the important functions and libraries that are imported for the project.

Steps Taken:
•	Feature selection: scoring of top ten features using ExtraTreeClassifier.
Sampling:
Oversampling: For oversampling of minority class we are using SMOTE.
Under sampling: For Under sampling we are using cluster centroid technique.
Supervised Learning:
a)	KNN
b)	Logistic Regression
c)	Decision Tree
d)	SVM
•	Ensemble Model (Bagging): Ensemble learning is based on the principle of combining a group of weak learners (base learners) that come together to form a strong learner.
•	Unsupervised Learning:
a)	K-Means:
•	Deep Learning
a)	Deep Neural Network:
Project status:
Project is finally completed with hybrid analysis result and ensemble model.
